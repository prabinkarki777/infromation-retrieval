Only a year or two ago, that was how long start-up companies generally had to cajole, fret and act nonchalant while waiting for venture capitalists to part with money -- if they proved willing to write a check at all. Even during robust times, the period between a first pitch meeting with a venture capitalist and financing typically spans three months."

entertainment,"An unsolved mystery is always fascinating; when that mystery involves a famous name and talk of gruesome circumstances, it can become a national obsession (see Simpson, O. J.). Such was the case with Michael Rockefeller's strange disappearance in Dutch New Guinea, which briefly dominated newspaper headlines in the fall of 1961. The event was newsworthy primarily because Michael happened to be the son of Nelson Rockefeller, then Governor of New York, and the great-grandson of John D. Rockefeller. But the story grew larger and more lurid because of persistent unproven rumors that Mr. Rockefeller, who was 22, had been killed and perhaps cannibalized by tribal headhunters."

entertainment,"BARRY BONDS may have hit 73 home runs last season, but a few years earlier he couldn't hit any off Henry Rowengartner, a 12-year-old who lives out a major league dream in ROOKIE OF THE YEAR (1993). Mr. Bonds is one of several real-life ballplayers to put in cameos in the film, stopping by just long enough to swing and miss against young Henry, appealingly played by Thomas Ian Nicholas. Some benign medical malpractice gets it all started: when Henry breaks his arm, whoever puts it back together doesn't quite do the job properly, and suddenly the boy can throw a 100-mile-per-hour fastball. The Chicago Cubs find out, sign him, and the rest is a pleasantly predictable baseball romp, perfect for this time of year - Thursday at 8 p.m. on the Family Channel."

entertainment,"In Robert Parrish's SADDLE THE WIND (1958), an intelligent little western about two brothers, John Cassavetes is a trigger happy extrovert and Robert Taylor, a gunfighter turned solid citizen. With his probing expressions Taylor (above with Julie London), in one of his final screen protrayals, makes us realize what a good restrained actor he was, although reviewers often ignored it. There's a grim showdown and the emphasis is on talk. Rod Serling's dislogue is excellent - blunt, thoughful and scathing, and the movie is admirably compact and well played, from the three stars to the affecting performance by Royal Dano in a sequence so strong that is almost cuts the picture in two - THURSDAY at 4 P.M. on TNT."

entertainment,"Generally fast, funny, festive and bright, THE GREAT RACE (1965) is a long, bulging movie comic-strip, culled from the good old days of sneering culprits, daredevil heroes, brave beauties and flying custard pies. A scrambly, international marathon of early-1900 autos, it carries the likes of Tony Curtis, Natalie Wood and Dorothy Provine, under Blake Edwards's blithe direction. The show-stealer is a sneering and villainous Jack Lemmon (above with Peter Falk). Expect a few lulls but not many.

entertainment,"The concept of Smell-o-Vision never really took hold in America's movie theaters, but it's very nearly a reality in John Waters's ""Hairspray."" During this bright, bouncy film's opening montage of early 60's teen-agers preparing their coiffures for a television dance program, it's almost possible to sniff the huge clouds of poison they spray onto their teased, empty heads. Such is the realism of ''Hairspray,'' which is hardly the only film to recapture this period (roughly that of ''American Graffiti'') but may be the worst looking. That &#151; a merry cavalcade of the period's most authentically awful props, fads and textiles &#151; appears to be exactly what Mr. Waters was after."

Later, when Hedwig meets a teenage boy, Tommy (Michael Pitt), destined to be a rock star, the boy asks, ''Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your lord and saviour?''

This is a one-of-a-kind, intensely visual film about a boy who has an almost successful sex-change operation and goes on to a pathetic music career.

This animated fantasy from DreamWorks stars the voices of Will Smith, Angelina Jolie and Renée Zellweger as the fish in that romantic triangle; Robert De Niro as the local mob boss; and Jack Black as Lenny (above), his sensitive, vegetarian son.

Like ''The Ice Storm,'' ''Sense and Sensibility'' and THE WEDDING BANQUET (1993), the comedy of cultural and sexual manners that first brought him to American moviegoers' attention.

Bob impresses her, even when he brings her a copy of Weird Tales magazine, but there are problems. He's creepily close to his mother and has some deep-seated anger. This film, directed by Dan Ireland, was released just before Ms. Zellweger won America's collective heart in ''Jerry Maguire.'' She might not have the courage to do Novalyne's unglamorous lumbering walk these days -- Sunday at 6 p.m. on WE."

In Marcel Camus's BLACK ORPHEUS (1959), set during Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, Orpheus (Breno Mello) is a guitarist in love with a country girl (Marpessa Dawn) who is being stalked by a man in a skeleton costume.

entertainment,"Some of the choice films on television this week are sleepers. Hollywood isn't depicted as the usual jaded jungle in Jack Sher's FOUR GIRLS IN TOWN (1956). The sensible, balanced tone of this unpretentious yarn about aspiring starlets was a mild jolt back then; it's a nice surprise now. The appealing quartet are Elsa Martinelli, Julie Adams, Marianne Cook and Gia Scala, flanked by George Nader and Sydney Chaplin. There's a super, haunting score by Alex North -- Monday at 4:30 P.M. on American Movie Classics. Fans of the occult should pounce on Herk Harvey's CARNIVAL OF SOULS (1962), a strange, riveting mystery sleeper set in Kansas (of all places) with no stars and not much of a budget. A pretty young woman (Candace Hilligoss) drives off a bridge, into a river. Next, she's calmly walking toward a distant, large tent with lights and music. Your move -- Tuesday at 9 P.M. and 1 A.M. on SCI-FI. James Stewart's strong performance is the reward of Andrew V. McLaglen's SHENANDOAH (1965). He's a widowed southern pacifist caught up in the Civil War through his family. The persuasive cast includes Doug McClure, Rosemary Forsyth, Patrick Wayne and Katharine Ross -- Monday at 9 P.M. on the movie map with a small boat and a cast of exactly three: Leon Niemczyk, Jolanta Umecka (in photo) and Zygmunt Malanowicz. Hang on; Polanski makes very little go a long way -- Sunday at 9 P.M., Friday at midnight on CUNY. For amusing nostalgia, try a blissfully brisk and tacky old Fox musical spotlighting Alice Faye -- a spoof of radio glory titled SING, BABY, SING (1936) which she does, nicely. The songs are neat and her colleagues are game: Adolphe Menjou and Gregory Ratoff. And Patsy Kelly and Ritz Brothers never hurt any picture. Sidney Lanfield directed -- Wednesday at 8 A.M. on Cinemax. HOWARD THOMPSON"

So it's a good time to rewatch HANNAH AND HER SISTERS (1986), a film that Mr. Allen appears to have made during a brief period of personal contentment. Mia Farrow, of course, plays Hannah, the rich, successful sister, who doesn't realize her marriage is in trouble. Lee (Barbara Hershey) is the restless sister, reconsidering her relationship with a famous painter. Dianne Wiest, who won a best supporting actress Oscar for this, is Holly, the sister who can't get a career or a relationship right. And Mr. Allen is Mickey, Hannah's hypochondriac ex-husband, who just can't stay away from the family.

Even space aliens, he suggested, preferred ""Bananas"" to ""Interiors."" In this film, Mr. Allen has it both ways. Radha Mitchell stars in parallel stories about the same character in the same situation: a woman who crashes a couple's dinner party. One story turns out comically; the other doesn't.

entertainment,"THE appeal of THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE (2003), Sylvain Chomet's dark animated adventure, isn't what moviegoers might expect. It's not the plot, about an elderly woman and her jowly dog searching for a Tour de France bicyclist (the woman's grandson), who has been kidnapped by gamblers. It's certainly not the dialogue; there are only a few words. It is absolutely the visuals -- of a Manhattan-like Belleville, its obese citizens, the hulking villains and the title characters, a trio of elderly singers. And it's the sound. The triplets now make music at home, with a contagious joy, using newspapers, the vacuum cleaner hose and the empty racks inside the fridge -- Thursday at 11:15 a.m. and Thursday/Early Friday at 12:30 a.m. on Starz."
entertainment,"IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT (1967) is a stinging, racially tense drama about a Southern sheriff (Rod Steiger) and a Northern black police sleuth (Sidney Poitier) investigating the same murder case in a predominantly white powder key of a town in the deep South. The film's only flaw is the mystery itself - a not very intriguing puzzle, although the story pivots on it. The real power of the picture lies in the two performances, helped along with the nimble pacing of Norman Jewison. The initial antagonism between the two men festers unabated until the moment the murder is solved. It's the best scene in the Oscar-winning picture and says volumes. Quincy Jones's score adds ajaszzy edge - SATURDAY at 10:20 P.M. on TBS."

This is just a piece of comedy fluff, but the adorable Ms. Garner makes it worth watching. Mark Ruffalo plays her formerly chubby best friend from childhood who has grown up to look awfully sexy.

The man (Bill Murray) is a middle-aged actor who's in Japan to make a whiskey commercial. He can't understand a word his director is saying, and the interpreter tends to translate long, rambling speeches into one sentence. The much younger woman (Scarlett Johansson) is accompanying her husband, a photographer, who has no time for her, leaving her to stare out her spectacular wall-to-wall hotel room window.

But that is not why ''Oliver Beene'' seems to be flouting the current tendency of network television toward the contemporary and hip. The most daringly backward step for this show, which has its premiere on Fox tonight at 8:30, may simply be that it is, in fact, a situation comedy."

And why move the story to New York? But casting Jude Law (left) makes up for a lot. Mr. Law is seductive as the handsome limousine driver who flits from woman to woman (among them, Marisa Tomei, Jane Krakowski and Sienna Miller), carefully avoiding commitment and meaning. The screenplay by Charles Shyer (who also directed) and Elaine Pope pulls off a neat trick: it finds an irreversible sexual betrayal that is as devastating to a 21st-century bachelor as that half-seen abortion was to Mr. Caine's Alfie. The depiction of older women is encouraging too. In the original, Shelley Winters seemed ridiculous; in this version, Susan Sarandon sizzles."

entertainment,"PEOPLE seem to remember three things about ATLANTIC CITY (1980). Susan Sarandon stroking her arms, shoulders and cleavage with lemon juice at her kitchen window. Burt Lanaster's comment ''The Atlantic Ocean was something then.'' And the fact that this very American story, about a resort town in painful transition, was directed by a Frenchman, Louis Malle. Not everyone remembers, however, that it was written by John Guare, before he became a star playwright with ''The House of Blue Leaves'' and ''Six Degrees of Separation.'' Ms. Sarandon plays a young woman from Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, working at a sushi bar at one of the new casinos, attending dealer school and studying French, with a dream of working in Monte Carlo someday. Lancaster, 67 and white-haired, plays a criminal whose exploits in the old days weren't nearly as glamorous as he pretends. Gun in hand, he finally does something he always dreamed of - Saturday at 2 p.m. on Channel 9."

entertainment,"TWO restless young men hop in their car and hit the highway, encountering new adventures and quirky characters at various colorful pit stops along the way. Sound familiar? If you're of a certain age, what may come to mind is ''Route 66,'' the early 1960's television series starring Martin Milner and George Maharis as free spirits tooling down the Interstate in a Corvette."
entertainment,"PLAYING the Marquis de Sade has to be an emotional high for an actor, and Geoffrey Rush revels in the challenge in Philip Kaufman's harrowing drama QUILLS (2000). Joaquin Phoenix is the abbé in charge of Sade at Charenton Asylum, and he does not approve of his prisoner's literary work (''It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions''). Michael Caine, the new doctor sent to advise the abbé, is busy locking up his new under-age wife (Amelia Warner), fresh from the convent (''She is a rare bird; I intend to keep her cared''). Kate Winslet is the chambermaid who's sneaking the marquis's new work, page by page, to his publisher. This is a wrenchingly violent film, but not in the usual ways -- Tuesday at 7:45 p.m on Cinemax."
entertainment,"When Warren Beatty won the best director Oscar for REDS (1981), none other than Orson Welles stood onstage and praised him. A lot of people had been comparing Mr. Beatty's film to Welles's ''Citizen Kane,'' and the older man just wanted to say that he'd be honored to have his work compared to ''Reds.'' Beatty's thrilling epic is about the Bolshevik Revolution as seen through the eyes of the idealistic, eventually disillusioned young writer John Reed (Beatty) and Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton), the woman he loves but frequently leaves. It's also a smart, funny portrait of optimistic young bohemians in New York not long after the turn of the last century. Jack Nicholson is unforgettable as Eugene O'Neill, particularly in his scenes with Ms. Keaton. And Maureen Stapleton received the best supporting actress Oscar as the antiwar activist Emma Goldman, holding on to her dream -- Thursday at 8 p.m., Thursday/Early Friday at 2.45 a.m. on AMC."
entertainment,"THE most spectacular moment in THE PERFECT STORM (2000) is the sight of that 90-foot wave. It's very bad news for the men on the Andrea Gail, a 72-foot swordfishing boat from Gloucester, Mass., whose catch has been light this year. The captain (George Clooney) can't afford to sit out the weather and let the fish spoil (the ice machine has just broken), so he tries to head home. The film is based on Sebastian Junger's book about tragic real-life events in October 1991 when three huge storm systems collided in the Atlantic. This film didn't receive any acting awards (although Cherry Jones is outstanding in a small part); it's about action (meteorologial) and effects. But, as others have pointed out, this is a story about fighting for your life; nuanced human interaction isn't always involved -- Saturday at 9 p.m. and Saturday/Early Sunday at 4:50 a.m. on HBO."
entertainment,"DAVE, Tim Robbins's character in MYSTIC RIVER (2003), makes the biggest mistake of his life (twice) by getting into the back seat of a car. He plays one of three boyhood friends in Boston whose lives converge again when the daughter of one of them (Sean Penn) is murdered. On the same night, Dave comes home late, telling his wife (Marcia Gay Harden) that he beat up a mugger and is afraid that he may have hurt him badly. The friends, including the policeman (Kevin Bacon) on the case, begin to suspect a connection. And that leads to tragedy. Mr. Penn and Mr. Robbins won acting Oscars; Clint Eastwood directed with dark ""Unforgiven""-style brilliance -- Saturday at 8:30 p.m. and Saturday/Early Sunday at 3:40 a.m. on HBO."

entertainment,"MANDELA AND DE KLERK traces the career of Nelson Mandela (played by Sidney Poitier, above) from his imprisonment in 1964 for organizing the African National Congress through his election to the presidency of South Africa three decades later. The film details the inside political maneuvering between Mr. Mandela, F. W. de Klerk (Michael Caine) and the hard-liner Prime Minister P. W. Botha (portrayed with verisimilitude by Gerry Maritz).For their part in ending apartheid, Mr. Mandela and Mr. de Klerk shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize."
