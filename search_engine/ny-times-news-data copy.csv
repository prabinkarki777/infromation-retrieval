entertainment,"An unsolved mystery is always fascinating; when that mystery involves a famous name and talk of gruesome circumstances, it can become a national obsession (see Simpson, O. J.). Such was the case with Michael Rockefeller's strange disappearance in Dutch New Guinea, which briefly dominated newspaper headlines in the fall of 1961. The event was newsworthy primarily because Michael happened to be the son of Nelson Rockefeller, then Governor of New York, and the great-grandson of John D. Rockefeller. But the story grew larger and more lurid because of persistent unproven rumors that Mr. Rockefeller, who was 22, had been killed and perhaps cannibalized by tribal headhunters."

Some benign medical malpractice gets it all started: when Henry breaks his arm, whoever puts it back together doesn't quite do the job properly, and suddenly the boy can throw a 100-mile-per-hour fastball. The Chicago Cubs find out, sign him, and the rest is a pleasantly predictable baseball romp, perfect for this time of year - Thursday at 8 p.m. on the Family Channel."

With his probing expressions Taylor (above with Julie London), in one of his final screen protrayals, makes us realize what a good restrained actor he was, although reviewers often ignored it. There's a grim showdown and the emphasis is on talk. Rod Serling's dislogue is excellent - blunt, thoughful and scathing, and the movie is admirably compact and well played, from the three stars to the affecting performance by Royal Dano in a sequence so strong that is almost cuts the picture in two - THURSDAY at 4 P.M. on TNT."

entertainment,"EARLY in John Cameron Mitchell's HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH (2001), Hedwig (Mr. Mitchell) reflects on his East German childhood: ''Our apartment was so small that Mother made me play in the oven.'' Later, when Hedwig meets a teenage boy, Tommy (Michael Pitt), destined to be a rock star, the boy asks, ''Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your lord and saviour?'' ''No,'' Hedwig answers cautiously, ''but I love his work.'' This is a one-of-a-kind, intensely visual film about a boy who has an almost successful sex-change operation and goes on to a pathetic music career. It's based on Mr. Mitchell's splashy Off Broadway musical, and he may well be the only person who can do the character justice -- Saturday at 8 p.m. and Saturday/Early Sunday at 1 a.m. on IFC."
entertainment,"SHARK TALE (2004) Saturday at 8 p.m. on HBO. It's one of those freakish accidents. A tough guy decides to mug a mild-mannered Everyman but accidentally kills himself in the process. When everybody assumes Oscar (the Everyman) saved himself, he decides just to go along and enjoy the hero worship, which includes being pursued by a femme fatale named Lola. That breaks the heart of the pretty receptionist who secretly loves him. And it all takes place deep in the ocean. This animated fantasy from DreamWorks stars the voices of Will Smith, Angelina Jolie and Renée Zellweger as the fish in that romantic triangle; Robert De Niro as the local mob boss; and Jack Black as Lenny (above), his sensitive, vegetarian son. The film doesn't have the charm of ""Finding Nemo,"" but it's fun and there are plenty of jokes for the grown-ups."

It's the story of a gay Chinese man (Winston Chao) living in Greenwich Village who decides he'll marry a woman (May Chin) -- in name only, of course -- just to shut his parents up. Unfortunately Mom and Dad decide to fly over from Taipei for the festivities.

The appealing quartet are Elsa Martinelli, Julie Adams, Marianne Cook and Gia Scala, flanked by George Nader and Sydney Chaplin. There's a super, haunting score by Alex North -- Monday at 4:30 P.M. on American Movie Classics. Fans of the occult should pounce on Herk Harvey's CARNIVAL OF SOULS (1962), a strange, riveting mystery sleeper set in Kansas (of all places) with no stars and not much of a budget. A pretty young woman (Candace Hilligoss) drives off a bridge, into a river. Next, she's calmly walking toward a distant, large tent with lights and music. Your move -- Tuesday at 9 P.M. and 1 A.M. on SCI-FI. James Stewart's strong performance is the reward of Andrew V. McLaglen's SHENANDOAH (1965). He's a widowed southern pacifist caught up in the Civil War through his family. The persuasive cast includes Doug McClure, Rosemary Forsyth, Patrick Wayne and Katharine Ross -- Monday at 9 P.M. on the movie map with a small boat and a cast of exactly three: Leon Niemczyk, Jolanta Umecka (in photo) and Zygmunt Malanowicz. Hang on; Polanski makes very little go a long way -- Sunday at 9 P.M., Friday at midnight on CUNY. For amusing nostalgia, try a blissfully brisk and tacky old Fox musical spotlighting Alice Faye -- a spoof of radio glory titled SING, BABY, SING (1936) which she does, nicely.

And Mr. Allen is Mickey, Hannah's hypochondriac ex-husband, who just can't stay away from the family. This is one of Mr. Allen's most satisfying dramatic comedies, and Hannah's apartment (rambling, prewar, Central Park West) is inspirational - Saturday at 1 and 9 p.m. on Oxygen."
entertainment,"MELINDA AND MELINDA (2004) Sunday at 3:15 p.m. on Cinemax Way back in ""Stardust Memories"" (1980), Woody Allen responded to some fans' preference for his early, straightforwardly funny films, rather than his attempts to emulate Ingmar Bergman. Even space aliens, he suggested, preferred ""Bananas"" to ""Interiors."" In this film, Mr. Allen has it both ways. Radha Mitchell stars in parallel stories about the same character in the same situation: a woman who crashes a couple's dinner party. One story turns out comically; the other doesn't. The ensemble cast includes Chloë Sevigny (far left, with Ms. Mitchell), Will Ferrell, Amanda Peet and Chiwetel Ejiofor. The New York apartments are fabulous."

When young moguls talk about starting a label, they say they aspire to be ''the next Motown''; when baby boomers want to jump-start a party, they put on Stevie Wonder's ''Uptight'' or Martha and the Vandellas' ''Dancing in the Street.'' Motown in its glory years, from the early 1960's through the mid-70's, was not only the ''hit factory'' that Mr. Gordy envisioned, but also the symbol of an American dream: harmony, both musical and racial, forged through inspiration and hard work."
